[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m finishing my PhD in Chemical Engineering at MIT in CSAIL. My research focuses on analytical approaches to understand how enzymes facilitate virtually impossible reactions at ambient conditions. During my doctorate, I studied how several enzymes catalyze reactions through an atomistic perspective using molecular dynamics coupled with quantum chemistry (QM/MM). From these simulations, we\u0026rsquo;ve created predictive models capable of identifying both the structural features most indicative of successful reactions, and the electronic underpinnings of such methods.\nI believe strongly in collaboration, teaching, and mentorship.
