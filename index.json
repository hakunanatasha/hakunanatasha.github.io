My research focuses on analytical and computational approaches to understand how proteins facilitate virtually impossible reactions at ambient conditions. During my doctorate, I studied how several enzymes catalyze reactions through an atomistic perspective using molecular dynamics coupled with quantum chemistry (QM/MM). From these simulations, we\u0026rsquo;ve created predictive models capable of identifying both the structural features most indicative of successful reactions, and the electronic underpinnings of such methods.\nIn addition to my doctoral work, I work on several side projects in the space of vision, language, and game design.
